# Analyzing Arsenic Data from the NJ Private Well Testing Act
## Tomer Solomon, December 2016 

This project is analyzing data from the NJ Private Well Testing Act. In essence, this act requires NJ landowners as well as buyers/sellers of NJ property to disclose the quality of the water, and I am interested in seeing how Arsenic values have changed over time as well as which counties in NJ are most problematic when it comes to having arsenic in their water data. Hope you enjoy my project!
